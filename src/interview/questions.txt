1. Write a function that adds two numbers. You should not use + or any arithmetic operators

2. We will name a number "aggregated number" if this number has the following attribute:
	just like the Fibonacci numbers
	1,1,2,3,5,8,13.....
	the digits in the number can divided into several parts, and the later part is the sum of the former parts.
	like 112358, because 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8
	122436, because 12+24=36
	1299111210, because 12+99=111, 99+111=210
	112112224, because 112+112=224
	so can you provide a function to check whether this number is aggregated number or not?
	question: are 1 and 11 aggregated numbers? in this solution they are not considered 

3. Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.
