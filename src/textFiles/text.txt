 “Barbarism of the African Race.


   The African race is a race of barbarians, and civilization to that
race would be an artificial state of existence.[3] The vestiges of
barbarism characterize the African, in his normal state. The latent
principle of cannibalism, lurks, in dormant energy, within the
very core of his being, and constitutes a prominent characteristic
of his animal existence. The economy and order of nature is no less
marked in the carnivorous than in the herbivorous mammalia and quad-
rumana; and although their physical distinctions are not always so
marked as to render apparent, to superficial observation, the uses
and functions of their entire organism, yet science has been a
tolerably faithful interpreter of cause and effect, and has not
failed to recognize those organic qualities, and the structural
adaptability of the African race, which qualify it for its mission as
the representative of barbaric fury and degradation, and the type, in
human form, of that chaotic element of self-annihilation, which nature
has kindly restricted to the fewest number of the lowest orders of
animated being.[4] The inhabitants of Southern and Central Africa, from
whence our slaves are drawn, the Feejeean, the Caffrarian, the New-
Zealander, and the Hottentot, “are stamped by nature with the unmistakable
character of unmitigated barbarism, and absolute antagonism to
civilization; and their improvement when brought in contact with
civilization is so slow as almost to escape detection. Indeed it is doubtful
whether the arts of European and American civilization have succeeded in so
fascinating the African race among us as to warrant the expectation of
permanency to the colony of Liberia, except from the light reflected by
constant and continued emigration; and it is believed, by many shrewd
philanthropists whose efforts have been long devoted to the cause of
African colonization, that should emigration to the colony cease, the
Negroes there would immediately relapse into their former habits and
customs, and ultimately resume their original character of cannibals.”
